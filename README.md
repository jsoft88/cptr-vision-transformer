# CPTR: Full Transformer Network for Image Captioning

## Configuration
To allow for autonomy and flexibility when building the model and training, a configuration is provided in two ways:
1) Through CLI params
2) Configuration file

For the second configuration type, a very simple query language to get the relevant sections from the file for the building blocks is provided.
